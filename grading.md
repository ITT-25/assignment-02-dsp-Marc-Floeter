## Marc Fl√∂ter (9/15P)

### 1 Karaoke Game (2/6P)
The given code would be scored with 4/6P. As you have worked together without marking who wrote which part, you are free to decide which of you gets how many of these points. Please inform us about your choice before Tuesday.

 * extremely flickery so the character is hardly visible which makes it nearly impossible to play 
 * frequency detection: had to adjust the volume threshold. afterward, it was ok 
 * optional: controls to (re)start or pause the game would be nice

### 2 Whistle Input (6.5/8P)

 * can't deal with background noise (-1)
 * I don't get why the GUI is 3D (? (-0.5), especially when you are already struggling with performance :D)

### Code is ok! (0.5/1P)

The given code is well-written. As you have worked together, we proceed as described above.

For now, this is just a warning. For the future: please tell us about such issues so we can find a solution together. Otherwise, we will have to grade your assignments with 0P. Your colleagues may not collaborate either - we want to be fair!
